I'll create a comprehensive PowerShell script for Azure resource migration between subscriptions and provide important considerations.



```powershell
# Connect to Azure (if not already connected)
Connect-AzAccount

# Parameters
$sourceSubscriptionId = "<source-subscription-id>"
$targetSubscriptionId = "<target-subscription-id>"
$sourceResourceGroup = "<source-resource-group>"
$targetResourceGroup = "<target-resource-group>"
$targetLocation = "<azure-region>" # Must be same as source location

# Function to validate prerequisites
function Test-MigrationPrerequisites {
    param (
        [string]$sourceSubId,
        [string]$targetSubId,
        [string]$sourceRG,
        [string]$targetRG
    )
    
    try {
        # Check source subscription access
        Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $sourceSubId
        $sourceSub = Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $sourceSubId
        if (-not $sourceSub) {
            throw "Source subscription not accessible"
        }

        # Check target subscription access
        Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $targetSubId
        $targetSub = Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $targetSubId
        if (-not $targetSub) {
            throw "Target subscription not accessible"
        }

        # Verify resource groups
        Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $sourceSubId
        $sourceRGExists = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name $sourceRG -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        
        Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $targetSubId
        $targetRGExists = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name $targetRG -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

        if (-not $sourceRGExists) {
            throw "Source resource group not found"
        }
        if (-not $targetRGExists) {
            throw "Target resource group not found"
        }

        return $true
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Prerequisite check failed: $_"
        return $false
    }
}

# Function to get moveable resources
function Get-MoveableResources {
    param (
        [string]$resourceGroupName
    )
    
    $resources = Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
    $moveableResources = @()
    
    foreach ($resource in $resources) {
        $validationResult = Move-AzResource -ResourceId $resource.ResourceId `
            -DestinationResourceGroupName $targetResourceGroup `
            -DestinationSubscriptionId $targetSubscriptionId `
            -WhatIf
        
        if ($?) {
            $moveableResources += $resource
        }
    }
    
    return $moveableResources
}

# Main migration function
function Start-ResourceMigration {
    param (
        [array]$resources
    )
    
    try {
        # Validate prerequisites
        if (-not (Test-MigrationPrerequisites -sourceSubId $sourceSubscriptionId `
                -targetSubId $targetSubscriptionId `
                -sourceRG $sourceResourceGroup `
                -targetRG $targetResourceGroup)) {
            throw "Prerequisites check failed"
        }

        # Set context to source subscription
        Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $sourceSubscriptionId

        # Get resource IDs for migration
        $resourceIds = $resources | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ResourceId

        # Initiate move operation
        $moveResult = Move-AzResource -ResourceId $resourceIds `
            -DestinationResourceGroupName $targetResourceGroup `
            -DestinationSubscriptionId $targetSubscriptionId `
            -Force

        Write-Output "Migration completed successfully"
        return $moveResult
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Migration failed: $_"
        throw
    }
}

# Execute migration
try {
    # Get moveable resources
    Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $sourceSubscriptionId
    $moveableResources = Get-MoveableResources -resourceGroupName $sourceResourceGroup
    
    # Start migration if resources found
    if ($moveableResources.Count -gt 0) {
        Write-Output "Found $($moveableResources.Count) resources eligible for migration"
        Start-ResourceMigration -resources $moveableResources
    }
    else {
        Write-Output "No eligible resources found for migration"
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Error during migration process: $_"
}

```

Here are the key points about Azure resource migration between subscriptions:

Moveable Resources:
1. Virtual Machines (with associated resources)
2. Storage Accounts
3. Virtual Networks
4. Network Security Groups
5. Public IP Addresses
6. Network Interfaces
7. Application Gateways
8. Recovery Services Vaults
9. SQL Databases
10. App Service Plans and Apps

Important Considerations:
1. Region Constraints:
   - Resources must stay in the same region
   - Cross-region moves aren't supported

2. Dependencies:
   - All dependent resources must be moved together
   - Some resources like VM + NIC + Disk must be moved as a unit

3. Service-Specific Limitations:
   - Some PaaS services can't be moved
   - Managed disks require special handling
   - Key Vault secrets need to be manually copied

4. Preparation Steps:
   - Ensure you have sufficient permissions in both subscriptions
   - Verify quota availability in target subscription
   - Back up critical data before migration
   - Plan for potential downtime

5. Post-Migration Tasks:
   - Update DNS records if applicable
   - Reconfigure monitoring and alerts
   - Update connection strings in applications
   - Verify all resources are working as expected

6. Resources That Cannot Be Moved:
   - Azure AD Domain Services
   - Express Route circuits
   - Some types of managed applications
   - Classic (ASM) resources
   - Resources with RBAC assignments

Would you like me to add any specific error handling or validation checks to the script?
