I’ve been reflecting on the certificate incident and wanted to share my thoughts on how we can prevent and mitigate such issues in the future.

When the incident landed in our queue, I initially sought more information since SSL-related issues don’t typically fall under our scope. However, it reminded me of a past project we worked on, so I decided to investigate further. Given the urgency surrounding the issue, I proceeded to troubleshoot and discovered the Application Gateway (AppGW).

At that point, my intention was to re-upload the backend authentication certificate (.CER) for the backend settings of the AppGW. However, I didn’t realize the AppGW was configured for SSL offloading, which handles decryption. I wasn’t expecting the SSL certificate to require a private key, but in hindsight, the involvement of a password should have alerted me to this.

There’s no excuse for this oversight, and I take full responsibility for the error. I’ll ensure I’m more cautious and thoughtful before taking action in the future. Your feedback and observations would mean a lot to me, as this incident has been on my mind quite a bit.

Thank you for understanding, and I’ll make sure to learn and grow from this experience.
