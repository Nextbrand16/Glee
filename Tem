Subject: Change Closure with Issues and Recommendations for Future Improvement

Dear Change Management Team,

I would like to provide an update on the change raised to power down 10 virtual machines as part of our scheduled activity.

Summary of Events:

Successfully Powered Down: 7 out of the 10 virtual machines were successfully powered down as planned.

Already Powered Down: 1 virtual machine was already powered down before the change window for pre-testing purposes.

Pending Power Down: 2 virtual machines were not powered down due to further testing required within the environment.


Additionally, during the process, a replica has remained available in the CF environment.

Issue Noted: The change has been marked as closed with issues due to the 2 virtual machines not being powered down and the replica remaining active.

Recommendations for Future Prevention: To avoid similar issues in future changes, the following actions are recommended:

1. Pre-Change Status Verification: Ensure all machinesâ€™ statuses are verified prior to the change window to confirm their initial state (e.g., powered on or powered off).


2. Clear Communication on Testing Needs: Collaborate with testing teams beforehand to confirm if any machines need to remain powered on for further testing, and include this as a known exception in the change plan.


3. Replica Management: Ensure replicas in environments like CF are explicitly accounted for and included in the scope of the change if they need to be powered down.


4. Post-Change Review: Conduct a thorough post-change review immediately after the window to ensure all targets are aligned with the change objectives and to address any discrepancies before closure.



We appreciate your attention to this and will implement these measures to improve the process in future changes.
