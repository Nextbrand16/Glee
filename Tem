Functional Document for Jump Box Deployment in Azure

1. Introduction

This document details the deployment of 10 jump boxes in Microsoft Azure, leveraging Terraform configuration and GitHub Actions for infrastructure automation. These jump boxes are designed for secure access and management of Azure resources. The network setup includes VNet peering with a centralized hub that houses a Palo Alto firewall. This document outlines the network, security, resilience, monitoring, and management setup to ensure a robust and secure environment.

2. Project Overview

Objective: To provide secure, resilient jump boxes for administrative and operational tasks in Azure.

Technology Stack:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions for automation of deployment and updates.

Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure.

Operating System: Windows Server 2022 (64-bit).



3. Jump Box Architecture

3.1 Network Design

Virtual Network (VNet): A dedicated VNet for jump boxes, peered with the hub VNet where the Palo Alto firewall resides.

VNet Peering: Traffic between the jump box VNet and the hub VNet (which houses the firewall) is enabled via VNet peering.

Subnets:

Jump Box Subnet: Jump boxes are deployed into a dedicated management subnet, protected by default Network Security Groups (NSG).


User Defined Routes (UDR):

All outbound traffic from the jump box subnet is routed through the Palo Alto firewall in the hub VNet.

A special UDR is created to route traffic for Windows KMS activation directly to the Internet, bypassing the firewall.



3.2 Resource Specifications

Instance Type: D3v4 Standard, optimized for workloads requiring high performance.

Operating System: Windows Server 2022.

Storage:

OS Disk: 128 GB.

Data Disk: 128 GB for application data and logs.



4. Security Design

4.1 Access Control

Active Directory (AD) Integration:

All jump boxes are joined to the abc.com domain.

Access to jump boxes is controlled via AD groups, with separate groups for Admins and Users.

Jump boxes are added to the RDS OU in Active Directory.


Authentication: Authentication is handled through Active Directory, with role-based access control (RBAC) enforced via AD groups.

NSG Configuration: Default NSG is applied to the jump box subnet to control access based on security policies.


4.2 Traffic Routing & Firewall

User Defined Route (UDR): A UDR is defined in the jump box subnet to route all outbound traffic through the Palo Alto firewall in the hub VNet.

Windows KMS Activation Traffic: A UDR is configured to route traffic for Windows activation directly to the Internet to ensure proper licensing compliance.

Endpoint Protection:

Core security applications (Carbon Black, Splunk agent, and Qualys) are deployed to all jump boxes for endpoint protection and vulnerability management.



4.3 Security Monitoring & Logging

Splunk Integration: Security logs from the jump boxes are sent to Splunk for centralized monitoring and analysis.


5. Resilience & Backup Strategy

Backup Policy:

All jump boxes are backed up using Azure Backup, in accordance with the organization's data protection policy. Backup retention and recovery processes are aligned with company policies to ensure business continuity.


Disaster Recovery:

In case of failure, jump boxes can be restored from Azure backups, ensuring minimal downtime.



6. Monitoring & Alerts

Azure Monitor:

Jump boxes are monitored using Azure Monitor for key performance metrics like CPU usage, disk utilization, memory usage, and uptime.

Custom dashboards in Azure Monitor provide real-time visibility into the health of the jump boxes.


Alerts:

Email notifications are triggered for threshold breaches on CPU, disk, and memory usage.

Azure Monitor is integrated with ServiceNow for automatic incident creation and tracking.


Log Analytics: All activity and diagnostics logs are sent to Azure Log Analytics for further analysis and troubleshooting.


7. Lifecycle Management

7.1 Application Deployment & Management

SCCM Integration: Jump boxes are connected to SCCM for application deployment and lifecycle management. SCCM ensures that all applications, patches, and updates are deployed according to the organization's security and compliance standards.


7.2 Core Applications

Carbon Black: Deployed for endpoint detection and response (EDR) to monitor and mitigate potential security threats.

Splunk: Installed on all jump boxes for log aggregation and security event monitoring.

Qualys: Deployed for continuous vulnerability management and patching.


8. CI/CD Workflow

Terraform Configuration:

Terraform is used for defining all infrastructure as code.

VNet, subnets, NSGs, UDRs, jump boxes, and peering are all managed through Terraform configuration files, ensuring consistent deployment.

Terraform state is managed using an Azure Storage Account to ensure collaboration across the team.


GitHub Actions:

The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions.

On every push or pull request, GitHub Actions triggers the deployment pipeline, which runs Terraform commands (terraform apply, terraform destroy).

Config files and workflows are stored in the organization's private GitHub repository to maintain control over the infrastructure lifecycle.



9. Support & Maintenance

Operational Support: The Azure team will perform Business-As-Usual (BAU) activities such as monitoring, patching, scaling, and managing backups.

Incident Management: Any issues are tracked and resolved through ServiceNow, which is integrated with Azure Monitor for automatic ticket generation.


10. Conclusion

The deployment of jump boxes into Azure using Terraform and GitHub Actions provides a scalable, secure, and automated solution for managing cloud resources. The use of best practices in security, backup, and monitoring ensures that the environment is robust, resilient, and compliant with organizational standards. The automation pipeline ensures repeatability and reduces the risk of manual errors during infrastructure changes.
